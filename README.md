I have been programming since the age of thirteen and also have professional experience with several languages (Python, C#).
I am passionate about new technologies in general, with Big Data, cybersecurity and AI being the ones that interest me the most and intend to continue my career in these fields to discover emerging applications and opportunities that these technologies bring.
